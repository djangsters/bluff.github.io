      <h2><a id="privacy">Privacy policy</a></h2>
      <p>The app can be used in any public channel without a need to be invited. However, it doesn't scan through all the channels in a workspace. The only information the app knows about the channel where the slash command was executed is the channel id.</p>
      <p>The app cannot access any messages outside the planning poker workflow.</p>
      <p>The app can list the users in a channel or in a custom group. This allows you to use group, @channel and @here mentions. The only information the app gets about the users is the user id and name.</p>
