      <p>The app can be used in any public channel without a need to be invited. However, it doesn't scan through all the channels in a workspace. The only information the app knows about the channel where the slash command was executed is the channel id.</p>
      <p>The app cannot access any messages outside the planning poker workflow.</p>
      <p>The app can list the users in a channel or in a custom group. This allows you to use @group, @channel and @here mentions. The only information the app gets about the users is just the user id and user name.</p>
      <p>The app stores and processed data from bidding rounds temporarily for up to 7 days. Bidding-round data older than 7 days is deleted permanently.</p>
      <p>The app is hosted on the Heroku platform (Salesforce.com, Inc., Salesforce Tower, 415 Mission Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94105, USA).</p>
